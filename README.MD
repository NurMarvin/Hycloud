> This system is still work in progress and might need heavy changes depending on the development of Hytale

First of all: this project started out of pure boredom and I know that I will probably need to change a lot of things
when the Hytale Server API releases. This however does not stop me from creating a general outline of a system with a
working Master and Daemon in place. \
The Hytale Server API integration will have to wait till Hytale (or just the Server API) has released but till then the
project will mainly focus on the Master and the Daemon.

###Development Discussion
As many projects in the gaming community, we have a [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/ZaCwPbj) that you are free to join. \
We will try our best to help you with issues that you are facing, coding or just general usage problems but don't expect
us to set it up for you.

### Todo
