### Contributing code
If you don't have a specific fix that you want to make, feel free to to pick a feature request from the issues:

[![GitHub issues by-label](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/NurMarvin/Hycloud/Feature%20Request.svg)](https://github.com/NurMarvin/Hycloud/labels/Feature%20Request)

When you contribute code, please make sure to follow simple Java style guides and most optimally follow the
[Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html). \
This makes development way easier for everyone and pull/merge requests that don't follow a simple to read Java style 
guide will not be accepted.
> Please also make sure to create issues based on the features you plan to add, so we can add those to the milestone.
